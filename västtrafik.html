<h2 class="rubrik-overview">PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
<h5 class="overview-brod-v">I had the opportunity to work on a comprehensive UX project for Västtrafik, a major public transportation provider in Västra Götaland. The project was divided into several stages, each with its own unique challenges and opportunities. In the first stage, I conducted in-depth interviews with members of the target group, in this case students, to develop a persona that accurately represented their goals, needs, behaviors and frustrations with the products of Västtrafik. In the second stage, I led both physical and remote usability testing to identify usability issues and pain points in Västtrafik's existing digital products, based on the users needs and issues me and my group members found in the interviews. In the third stage, I developed my prototyping skills to create both mid and high fidelity prototypes that addressed the issues raised in the earlier stages. We conducted a usability test on our mid fidelity prototype to see if our users understood our solutions.
Finally, I delivered a compelling presentation to the Västtrafik team, demonstrating the value of our work and the impact it would have on their business. Throughout the project, I utilized my skills in user research, usability testing, prototyping, and presentation to deliver a comprehensive and effective solution.</h5>

<section class="problem-sec-v">
<div class="problem-text-v"><h2 class="underrubrik-vasttrafik">PROBLEM</h2>
<h5 class="brod-vasttrafik">One of the main issues that we found frustrated the users was the map icon that led them out of the application and into Google Maps. This feature was particularly frustrating because it interrupted the user's flow and forced them to switch between applications. The users wanted to stay within the app to maintain a seamless experience and avoid confusion or errors in navigation.
Another finding related to the issue was that users had difficulty comprehending the functionality associated with the icon. Although they recognized it as a map-related feature, they did not fully comprehend that it specifically provided the path from their location to the bus stop.</h5></div>

<section class="solution-sec-v">
<div class="solution-pic-v"><img class="solution-pic-v-a" src="Pictures/Västtrafik solution.png" alt="Two Iphones, each with a prototype view that could solve the problem" width="400" height="auto"></div>
<div class="solution-text-v"><h2 class="underrubrik-vasttrafik">SOLUTION</h2>
<h5 class="brod-vasttrafik">We addressed the Google Maps icon issue by implementing an integrated map solution, utilizing an already existing embedded map feature within the To Go-app. The primary distinction is that GPS activation is not possible, yet, this issue can be addressed by incorporating the Google icon(and clarifying that it is Google and not just a map) within the map interface instead, which allows users to activate GPS functionality if desired but lowers the risk of inadvertently exiting the app. Ideally, we would fully integrate the GPS feature to eliminate the need for Google Maps altogether; however, this solution may entail more significant expenses. 
To minimize the risk of unintentionally entering the wrong function, it is imperative to provide users with a clear understanding of the icon's functionality. As such, we clarified by replacing the icon with a button and adding the text "Se gångväg" (See walking path). This could reduce user frustration.
Of course, we could have only changed the icon to a more familiar one that makes the user understand that it is google. But because the app already had a map inside, it would be wrong not to use it to help the users.</h5></div>

<section class="goal-sec-v">
<div class="goal-text-v"><h2 class="underrubrik-vasttrafik">OUR GOAL</h2>
<h5 class="brod-vasttrafik">The goal of our UX project was to create a user-centered design that helps our users achieve their goals quickly and easily, while eliminating any frustration they may experience along the way. We want to understand our users' needs, preferences, and pain points, and use that knowledge to design an intuitive and efficient user experience that meets their expectations.</h5></div>

<section class="process-sec-v">
    <h2 class="underrubrik-vasttrafik-process">DESIGN PROCESS</h2>
    <h5 class="brod-vasttrafik-process">After identifying usability issues in the product, our group held a lengthy meeting to brainstorm different solutions. We recognized the importance of designing with our users in mind, so we decided to create individual solutions and test them with users to determine their effectiveness.
        To begin, each member of the group designed a mid-fidelity wireframe, taking care to incorporate feedback from our initial research and from the group discussion. These wireframes served as the starting point for our individual solutions.
        Next, we conducted usability tests on our wireframes to see how well they addressed the usability issues we had identified. The feedback we received was promising, and we used it to refine our designs further.
        With the feedback from the usability tests in mind, we each created a high-fidelity wireframe that reflected our final solution. These high-fidelity wireframes were polished and carefully crafted to provide a more accurate representation of the final design.
        Finally, we presented our high-fidelity wireframes to both the class and Västtrafik, confident in our designs and the research-backed solutions they offered. Our design process was centered on understanding our users' needs and preferences and using that understanding to craft user-centered solutions. By testing and refining our designs along the way, we were able to create effective solutions that addressed the usability issues in our product.</h5>

<section class="learn-sec-v">
<h2 class="underrubrik-vasttrafik-learn">WHAT DID I LEARN?</h2>
<h5 class="brod-vasttrafik">• Designing high fidelity wireframes took a lot more time than I expected.
• I realized that it was much harder than I thought it would to come up to waterproof solutions. It was easy to brainstorm, but to analyze the impact on other functions was fun yet a lot more complex.
• We should have conducted the brainstorm method "crazy eight" instead of just discussing possible solutions.
• I did learn how fragile it could be to make big changes, and that it does not make it greater just because it is big.</h5>
